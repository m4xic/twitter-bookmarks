# Twitter Bookmarks Bot

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

# How-to

Full instructions TK. For now, this is [a clean version of the AirTable](https://airtable.com/shrSEIe5nCW2qzSsf) base (sign up using my [referral link](https://airtable.com/invite/r/YeJtcOdS) if this bot was useful for you!) and you can use the **Deploy to Heroku** button above to quickly spin up a dyno that runs the bot.

# You break it, you fix it

I've basically just made this for myself (to avoid paying for Twitter Blue hehehe) but in case anyone else finds it, this is liable to break, you can make an Issue with any bugs but I can't guarantee they'll be fixed! ❤️
